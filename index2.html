         <li> The Birth of Tragedy (1872)  </li>   
         <div class="block">
           
                The first work Nietzsche published describes the tragic feeling of life, as a typical philosophical aspect of modernity.
                According to the German existentialist, this feeling is mainly expressed through music, 
                therefore tragedy played a dominant role within the framework of the aesthetic conceptions through the consecutive eras.
            </div>

         <li>Human, All Too Human  (1878) </li> 
         <div class="block">
            
            Nietzsche's(Human, All Too Human) begins with thoughts concerning metaphysics, called "On First and Last Things," its title suggesting issues about causality and teliology. 
            This chapter also introduces issues about lack of human contentment and issues about language and expression.

            <div class="block">
            <ul style ="list-style-type:disc;">
                
                <li >The second section is "On the History of Moral Feelings", which title anticipates Nietzsche's arguments against religion-based morality (or traditional ethics wholesale).</li>

                <li>After that is "From the Soul of Artists and Writers". Although it sounds poetic and artistically inspired, 
                    this section primarily denounces the notion that art and literature are divinely inspired.</li>

                <li>"Man in Society and Women and Child", is also anti-Darwinian and contains aphorisims about gender and family and their evolution. 
                    This is similar to the next section, "Man Alone with Himself", which applies metaphysical principles to man's existence and search for meaning. </li>

                All in all, the work seeks to explain facets of human life in light of Nietzsche's atheistic and skeptical philosophy.
                It adds a fuller-bodied explanation to questions of life and its value in the aphoristic style of late-19th century German philosophy. </p>
             </div>

         <li>The Gay Science (1882)</li>  
         <div class="block"> 
              The Gay Science was originally published in 1882 with a second edition published five years later expanded to include an additional "fifth book" as well as an appendix of songs.
              Although the title is perhaps not quite as familiar to those relatively unfamiliar with Friedrich Nietzsche as Thus Spake Zarathustra or Beyond Good and Evil, 
              this is the volume introduces many of the most famous of the philosopher's concepts.
              As such, the content of The Gay Science depends more heavily upon the inclusion of poems and works of verse than any other single book ever published in his lifetime.
              When originally translated into English, this book bored the title The Joyful Wisdom, 
              but subsequent translations focused on the significance of poetry in its construction and refers to a French expression which references the technical rather than the more abstract artistic ability involved in writing verse.

         <li>Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883) </li> 
         <div class="block">
              One of the most famous philosophical book of the last 150 years was published in 1892.
              Even the most unfamiliar with philosophy have it in their library, or have at least heard about Thus Spoke Zarathustra.
              Nietzsche described it as his deepest philosophical work, the most representative reflection of his thinking and vision,
              referring to the issue of the death of God and Ubermensch's appearance.  
         </div>

         <li>Beyand good and Evil (1886)  </li>     
         <div class="block">
             The overarching theme of this work is Nietzsche's contention that progress is impossible in the face of acquiescence to conventional notions of morality and ethics.
             Since those values were created by men for the purpose of controlling the masses, the only way forward progression of civilization can ever be possible is if there are people of courage willing to trust their own instinct and then act on that instinct. 
             In this way, progress moves beyond contemporary notions of good and evil to establish a new set values which must, in turn, eventually be rejected and moved beyond by a new breed of people acting on their instincts. </div>

         <li>On the Genealogy of Morality (1887) </li> 
         <div class="block">
             Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil is a critique of sciences, politics, and art of the modern world through a collection of aphorisms and commentary. The author uses epigrams to shine a unique light on truth and nature. 
             His exclusive perspective could stem from the fact that he was without a stable home and in chronic pain while writing the book. The text consists of nine themes with a poem at the end. 
             The author holds the belief that most philosophies are a projection of the philosopher. He expresses that a strong person explores their own preconceived ideas and independence in order to discover more about themselves.
             Regarding independence, Nietzsche refers to the masses as a herd that follows the same mentality without question. He further condemns philosophers that do the same. 
             Those that follow this line of thinking support the proliferation of mediocrity through concepts that render everyone equally ordinary, such as “common” sense.
