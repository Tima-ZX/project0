            Nietzsche was a German philosopher, essayist, and cultural critic. His writings on truth, morality, 
            language, aesthetics, cultural theory, history, nihilism, power, consciousness, 
            and the meaning of existence have exerted an enormous influence on Western philosophy and intellectual history. </p>
        <p>
            Nietzsche spoke of the death of God, and foresaw the dissolution of traditional religion and metaphysics.
            Some interpreters of Nietzsche believe he embraced nihilism, rejected philosophical reasoning, and promoted a literary exploration of the human condition, 
            while not being concerned with gaining truth and knowledge in the traditional sense of those terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nietzsche claimed the exemplary human being must craft his/her own identity through self-realization and do so without relying on anything transcending that life-such as God or a soul. 
            This way of living should be affirmed even were one to adopt, most problematically, a radical vision of eternity, one suggesting the eternal recurrence of all events.
            According to some commentators, Nietzsche advanced a cosmological theory of - will to power-.
            But others interpret him as not being overly concerned with working out a general cosmology. 
            Questions regarding the coherence of Nietzsche's views-questions such as whether these views could all be taken together without contradiction, 
            whether readers should discredit any particular view if proven incoherent or incompatible with others,
            and the like-continue to draw the attention of contemporary intellectual historians and philosophers.

        <p>
                Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was born October 15, 1844, the son of Karl Ludwig and Franziska Nietzsche.
                Karl Ludwig Nietzsche was a Lutheran Minister in the small Prussian town of Rocken, near Leipzig.
                When young Friedrich was not quite five, his father died of a brain hemorrhage, leaving Franziska, Friedrich, a three-year old daughter, Elisabeth, and an infant son. 
                Friedrich's brother died unexpectedly shortly thereafter (reportedly, the legend says, fulfilling Friedrich's dream foretelling of the tragedy). 
                These events left young Friedrich the only male in a household that included his mother, sister, paternal grandmother and an aunt, although Friedrich drew upon the paternal guidance of Franziska's father.
                Young Friedrich also enjoyed the camaraderie of a few male playmates.

                After spending time in psychiatric clinics in Basel and Jena, Nietzsche was first placed in the care of his mother, and then later his sister (who had spent the latter half of the 1880's attempting to establish a "racially pure" German colony in Paraguay with her husband, the anti-Semitic political opportunist Bernhard Foerster). 
                By the early 1890s, Elisabeth had seized control of Nietzsche's literary remains, which included a vast amount of unpublished writings. 
                She quickly began shaping his image and the reception of his work, which by this time had already gained momentum among academics such as Georg Brandes. Soon the Nietzsche legend would grow in spectacular fashion among popular readers.
                From Villa Silberblick, the Nietzsche home in Weimar, Elisabeth and her associates managed Friedrich's estate, editing his works in accordance with her taste for a populist decorum and occasionally with an ominous political intent that (later researchers agree) corrupted the original thought. Unfortunately, Friedrich experienced little of his fame, having never recovered from the breakdown of late 1888 and early 1889. 
                His final years were spent at Villa Silberblick in grim mental and physical deterioration, ending mercifully August 25, 1900. He was buried in Rocken, near Leipzig. Elisabeth spent one last year in Paraguay in 1892-93 before returning to Germany, where she continued to exert influence over the perception of Nietzsche's work and reputation, particularly among general readers, until her death in 1935. 
                Villa Silberblick stands today as a monument, of sorts, to Friedrich and Elisabeth, while the bulk of Nietzsche's literary remains is held in the Goethe-Schiller Archiv, also in Weimar.
